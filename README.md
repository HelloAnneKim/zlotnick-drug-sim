Zlotnick drugs!


**Why:** Understand the behavior of viral capsid assembly in the absence and presence of varying drug concentrations

**Scope:** 
1.  Reproduce viral capsid assembly model from "A Theoretical Model Successfully Identifies Features of Hepatitis B Virus Capsid" by Zlotnick et al. Model will use ODE's in MATLAB for the assembly of capsid monomers to form a final dodecahedron capsid.
2.  Extend Zlotnick model to include varying concentrations of drugged monomers.


**Status:** Unfinished.
